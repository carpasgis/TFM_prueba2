# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction and NLP-Based Clinical Decision Support System

## Overview

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent a major global health challenge and are one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. In Spain, myocardial infarction is one of the most common conditions within this category. The implementation of advanced technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) offers new avenues to improve both diagnosis and clinical management of CVD.

This project focuses on the development and implementation of a system designed to **support clinical cardiology**. The system integrates **Machine Learning models** with **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques based on **Transformers architecture** to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease and assist with the interpretation of medical documents.

### Objectives
- **Predict cardiovascular risk** using a database of patients with cardiovascular disease.
- Leverage **NLP techniques** to analyze complex medical documents and extract relevant clinical information.
- Provide additional support for **clinical decision-making** and improve the early diagnosis and management of CVD.
- Assist in the **therapeutic planning** and **medical follow-up** of patients with risk factors such as hypertension or hypercholesterolemia.

## Features
- **Machine Learning models** for cardiovascular disease risk prediction.
- **NLP system** for analyzing medical texts and extracting useful information for clinicians.
- Integration with **Transformers-based architectures** to support both structured data analysis and unstructured text processing.
- **Personalized patient management** for optimizing the treatment of patients with specific clinical risk factors.

## Technologies
- **Python**
- **Machine Learning algorithms** (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Deep Learning with Transformers**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **PyTorch** / **TensorFlow**
- **Pandas** / **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** for data visualization

## Dataset
The system uses a dataset of patients with cardiovascular diseases, including:
- **Clinical risk factors**: age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.
- **Medical records**: text-based reports analyzed with NLP tools.

## Results
The ML model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting cardiovascular disease risk. The NLP-based system was effective in extracting meaningful clinical insights from complex medical documents, aiding clinicians in their decision-making process. This system aims to enhance early diagnosis and facilitate more personalized treatment plans for patients at risk of cardiovascular diseases.

## Installation
To set up the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cvd-risk-prediction.git
    cd cvd-risk-prediction
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the machine learning model and NLP system:
    ```bash
    python run_model.py
    ```

## Usage
